          <h3>sustainably & ethics</h3>
          <p>We respect and love Mother Earth and as a brand we take responsibility to reduce the impact we have on the environment as much as we can and this is something we will never compromise on. Everything used to run our company, from paper to packaging is made from recycled materials and can either biodegrade or be recycled once finished with.</p>
          <p>We are also proud to use a high percentage of low impactful fabrics and fibres for our ranges. Something we have learnt on our journey of sustainability is that it’s not possible to be 100% friendly to the environment as a fashion brand, but what we can do is continually progress the way we create and ensure our pieces have longevity in not just design but also quality. 
            We currently work with a mix of recycled, organic, natural, low impactful and some dead stock fabrics and are always looking for new sustainable options we can implement into our ranges. You can read more about our fabrics and their impact here. Sometimes we also use a very small percentage of Nylon or Polyester (recycled where we can) in our knitwear or deadstock. We found that sometimes completely natural fibres weren’t always holding up in quality after wear and washing, so these fibres can add that longevity so that the pieces can really stand the test of time. If something completely natural isn’t going to look good and last after a handful of washes, we don’t see this as responsible. We feel true sustainability comes with a balance; making sure that long lasting quality is also prioritised along side natural fibres. We highly recommend everyone on a journey to being more sustainable to invest in one of our GuppyFriend Wash Bags, they help to stop microfibres from your clothes going to the ocean when you wash them.

          <p>Creating ethically is also something very important to us, since we established in 2015 we’ve worked with the same small factory in China with whom we have a very close and loyal relationship; we know our team well and they produce our designs helping to ensure that there is minimal to no wastage. We have also added a knitwear and swimwear factory which we have built great relationships with to create varied products to our ranges making sure to put sustainability first. All of our factory workers receive fair and above average wages and we have an on site agent who makes sure working conditions are safe and our workers are happy on a weekly basis. We also make visits ourselves when we can.</p>
          <p class="imp" style="margin-top: 2vw; font-weight: 600;">It’s truly important to us that the clothes we sell don't have an ugly past.</p>
